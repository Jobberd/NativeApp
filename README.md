Dashboard - This app has not yet any use, but was supposed to be 
an overview for common apps (such as mail/phone/messages/maps). 
However due to time issues (only this week) it is only really some 
views for me to get accustomed with AndroidStudio. 

PS: It is made for the Nexus 7 view, since I own that device
PS2: There is a issue with the memory usage of the images, which I 
have not been able the resolve yet.
